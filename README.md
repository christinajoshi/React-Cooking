## Very basic and quick recipe application. Very little CSS. Building front-end using React for learning purposes. Will eventually add functionality, change layout, make it look pretty, and connect to database; possibly using express framework and MongoDB. 

## Application Functionality
Add, Edit and Remove recipes <br />
Navigate to About page

## Hooks and other tech used
Routes <br />
useState <br />
useEffect <br />
useContext <br />
localStorage only until hook up to db 

## Notes on comments

Massive number of comments to help learn. In the workplace before anything goes to production or sometimes even development, I remove unnecessary comments.
