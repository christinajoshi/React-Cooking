## Very basic and quick recipe application. Building front-end using React for learning purposes. *Very* little CSS; just wanted buttons to have colors, that's all.  Will eventually add functionality, change layout/make it look pretty, and connect to database. 

## Application Functionality
Add, Edit and Remove recipes <br />
Navigate to About page

## Hooks and other tech used
Routes <br />
useState <br />
useEffect <br />
useContext <br />
localStorage only until hook up to db <br />
Material UI 

## Notes on comments

Massive number of comments to help learn. In the workplace before anything goes to production or sometimes even testing, I remove unnecessary comments.
